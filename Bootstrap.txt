1. What are the advantages of Bootstrap? 

Ans: Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
     Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
     Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
     Browser compatibility: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera) 

2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

Ans:   In Bootstrap, container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive behaviors of your layout. It contains the row     	  	  elements and the row elements are the container of columns (known as grid system). The container class is used to create boxed 		  	  content.

3. What are the default Bootstrap text settings?

Ans: Bootstrap 4 Default Settings:
	Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-	serif. In addition, all <p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).

4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

Ans: The Bootstrap Grid System is used for layout, specifically Responsive Layouts. Understanding how it works is vital to understanding 		 Bootstrap. 

           The Grid is made up of groupings of Rows & Columns inside 1 or more Containers.

           The Bootstrap Grid can be used alone, without the Bootstrap JavaScript and other CSS Components. You just need to download and 		   reference the

           “bootstrap-grid.css” which contains the Grid and Flexbox classes. More info on only using the Bootstrap Grid CSS is here in the docs.

              The Rules of the Grid:
	1. Columns must be the immediate child of a Row.
	2. Rows are only used to contain Columns, nothing else.
	3. Rows should be placed inside a Container.

	Example :
			
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html lang="en">
		<head>
  		<meta charset="UTF-8">
 		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  		<title>Document</title>
		</head>
		<body>
  			<div class="row">
  		       		<div class="col-md-8">
    		            <div class="pb-3">
      			      	.col-md-8
    		            </div>
    			<div class="row">
      		    		<div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
      		    	<div class="col-md-6">.col-md-6</div>
    		 	</div>
  	                </div>
  	                		<div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
	               </div>
		</body>
		</html>

The alert classes are: .alert-success, .alert-	info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger, .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light and .alert-dark.

	Step 1: 
	Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the <head> tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
 
	<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css”>
	<script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js”></script>

	<script src=”https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js”></script>

	Step 2:

	<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  	A simple warning alert—check it out!
	</div>
